        "reasoning": "Approached this by first defining key terms (climate change, agricultural productivity), then examining peer-reviewed studies on temperature changes, precipitation patterns, and crop yields. Considered both direct effects (temperature stress) and indirect effects (pest populations). Evaluated regional variations and adaptation strategies.",
        "answer": "Climate change significantly impacts agricultural productivity through multiple pathways. Key findings: 1) Temperature increases reduce yields for major crops by 5-15% per degree Celsius. 2) Changing precipitation patterns create both drought and flood risks. 3) CO2 fertilization effects are offset by other climate factors. Recommendations: Implement adaptive farming practices, develop heat-resistant crop varieties, and improve water management systems."

Evaluated limitations and ethical considerations.",
        "answer": "Machine learning shows promising results in medical diagnosis but faces significant challenges. Key findings: 1) ML models achieve high accuracy in specific diagnostic tasks (e.g., 95% in detecting certain cancers). 2) Integration into clinical workflow remains a major hurdle. 3) Ethical concerns include bias in training data and lack of transparency. Recommendations: Focus on hybrid human-AI systems, improve model interpretability, and establish robust validation protocols."
